# Chapter 5 Iteration

## While Loops
* While loops are composed of 3 parts:
  * The initialization of the Iterator
  * The While Conditional
  * The iteration of the Iterator

* Without the last step, the While loop will become an Infinite loop, never ending

* Some infinite loops can be used constructively, provided you have a "break" statement in some portion of the code

* You can use the "continue" keyword to skip to the next iteration, which can be used to skip over processes that you deem not fitting for the situation

## For Loops
* For loops are used in python to loop through a definite set of things, such as a list or a dictionary

* For loops are definite and will always come to an end, While loops are indefinite and must be forced into ending

* The syntax of a For loop looks like this:
    for item in list:
      # Do a thing
